    <h1>Objets d'Art</h1>
      <p>We love the web, but we think that it's become a little too utilitarian. It's more than just a way to buy shoes. In a very real sense, it's where modern people live. We believe that there should be some oases in the commercial desert. Websites like pieces by Takemitsu. Art that creates a space for contempation and enjoyment.</p>
      <p>Links to our objets d'art are below.</p>
