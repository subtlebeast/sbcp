    <h1>Web Design</h1>
      <p>We offer both semi-custom and bespoke web design services. Semi-custom servie involves the use of a pre-existing theme platform [ours or someone else's (your choice)], which can then tweaked to reflect a particular client's design preferences.</p>

      <p>A bespoke website is tailored to a client's peculiar requirements from the ground up. Note that this doesn't mean that you will necessarily get exactly what you want. Regarding bespoke websites, we take the approach as those at <a href="http://www.rivbike.com/product-p/f-custom.htm">Rivendell Bicycle Works</a>. We, "absolutely listen to your wishes and input, and in fact require it, want it, and use it. But ultimately it is our name that goes on the bike, so certain consistencies and standards must be met, for it to bear our name. For that reason, before ordering a Rivendell custom, it's important to familiarize yourself with our values and style, and make sure we're a good match."</p>

      <p>Finally, we do not maintain websites, though we <em>do</em> provide instruction on self-maintenace as part of every client package. We also offer website updating services.</p>
