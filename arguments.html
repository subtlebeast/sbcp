    <h1>Arguments</h1>
      <p>Hemingway once asked what we're here for if not to help one another. Thomas Paine said that his religion was to do good. We like these ideas. Money is nice, but it's not as nice as having a beneficial purpose. We find happiness in helping, and one of the ways that we choose to help is by making web site arguments that advocate for a change that we thing would make the world better. Click on the links below to view our past arguments. If you'd like to suggest an argument, use the form at the bottom of this page.</p>
